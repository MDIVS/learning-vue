# Learning Vue JS
Hi, I'm just learning Vue.js and having some fun.

# Google Auth
Well, I was curious about how simple it is to authenticate with Google and here it is:

| Enter (login) view | Profile view |
| ------------ | ------------------ |

With a few lines of code I just made an Google Authentication. Well, I'm not storing the google token in the most secure way but it is just fine as I wont create an entire backend just for learning Vue.js ðŸ˜….

# Minigames
The project comes with some minigames I made for fun with ChatGPT o3 help. Have fun testing!

| Timer game | Inventory game |
| ---------- | -------------- |
